opened = {0}
--> This set keeps track of all the boxes that have been opened.
queue = deque([0])
--> This queue will manage the boxes as we process them using BFS


c_box = queue.popleft()
--> Removes and returns the box at the front of the queue. This is the current box being processed.

key not in opened:
--> Ensures the box corresponding to the current key hasnâ€™t been opened yet. This prevents wasteful reprocessing of boxes.

key < len(boxes):
--> Ensures the key corresponds to a valid box (i.e., the key number must be a valid index within the boxes list).

queue.append(key):
--> Adds the box (that the key opens) to the queue for processing.

opened.add(key):
--> Marks this box as opened by adding the key to the opened set.

return opened == set(range(len(boxes)))
--> Generates a set containing all possible box indices (from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of boxes).

Compares the opened set with the set of all box indices. If they are equal, it means all boxes have been successfully opened, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
