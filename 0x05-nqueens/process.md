what's the purpose of this script ?

    -- solve the N Queens problem, which involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. The script takes an integer 𝑁 as a command-line argument and prints all possible solutions, where each solution is a list of coordinates indicating the positions of the queens.

why ?

    -- The N Queens problem is a 'classic example of a constraint' satisfaction problem and can be solved efficiently using backtracking. This script is structured to handle input validation, use sets for efficient conflict detection, and employ recursion for exploring all possible configurations.

Lets breakdown the script:

    1- we import sys to handle comandline arguments and exit the program with specific status code >> ./0-nqueens.py 4

    and at the next step we check the number of command-line arguments 
    >> if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print('Usage: nqueens N')
        sys.exit(1)
    why we check the number ? >> to ensure that exactly one argument is provided, if not ? exit the program

    and at the next step we try to convert the argument to an integer 
    >> try:
            N = int(sys.argv[1])
       except valueError:
            print('N must be a number')
    sys.exit(1)
    why we convert the argument to integer ? >> convert the command line argument to an integer. if the number passed as string form like '4'.

    and at the next step we check if the integer number is at least 4
    >> if N < 4:
        print('N must be at least 4')
        sys.exit(1)
    why ? to ensure N is at least 4 bec the problem is not solvable for smaller values

    so now we can define the function to solve N Queens problem
    def solveNqueens(N):
        col = set() >> tracks coulmns that are under attack
        pos = set() >> tracks positive diagonals (row + col) that are under attack
        neg = set() >> tracks negative diagonals (row - col) that are under attack

        final_result  = [] >> stores all valid board configurations
        board = [[] for n in range(n)] >> Represents the board, initialized with empty lists for each row.

    now , you need to make recursive function to solve the problem 
    def solve(row): >> Attempts to place a queen in each row recursively
        if row == n: >> base case
            final_resut.append(board.copy()) 
            return >> If all rows are processed (row == n), a valid configuration is found, and it's added to final_result.

            for i in range(n):
                if i in col or (row + i) in pos or (row - i) in neg:
                    continue
            >> For each column i in the current row, checks if placing a queen is safe. Skip the column if placing a queen at (row, i) would cause a conflict with existing queens.

                col.add(i)
                pos.add(row + i)
                neg.add(row - i)

                board[row] = [row, i] >> If safe, updates sets and board[row] with the queen's position.
                solve(row + 1) >> Calls itself with row + 1 to place the next queen.
                >> Place the queen at (row, i) and update the sets tracking columns and diagonals under attack.


                Backtrack: Removes the queen and reverts changes to try the next column.
                col.remove(i)
                pos.remove(row + i)
                neg.remove(row - i)
                board[row] = []

                solve(0)
                return final_result
                >> Initialize the recursive solving process starting from row 0 and return the list of solutions.
